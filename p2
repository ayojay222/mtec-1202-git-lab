GALAGA MINI
This game is about having a spaceship shooting against the enemy who are also trying to attack you as well, you just have to avoid it at all costs reach the highest score without dying. 

I want to build this game because this has been one of my first projects in MTEC 1201, it turned out successful but I wanted to dig more deeper and making it very digital and designing things from scratch and which I feel like would be cool.  
I would say the interaction would be to use the mouse to move from side to side and using the left click to shoot out lasers to attack targets. 
To win galaga wars is by managing your ship's health and power-ups to survive as long as possible is necessary to win Galaga Wars. You must maneuver your spaceship through waves of alien enemies, shooting them down with your primary weapon while avoiding their attacks, aiming to capture and release captured fighters to gain a "twin fighter" advantage.
